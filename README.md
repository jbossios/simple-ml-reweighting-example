# Train a network to learn to reweight a distribution into another one

In the Jupyter notebook titled ```simple_reweighting_example.ipynb```, you can find a simple example using ```pytorch``` and ```numpy``` on how to train a network to learn to reweight a distribution into another one. On this example, you will learn to weight data generated from a Gaussian probability distribution centered at 10 with a standard deviation of 1 to get data distributed following a Gaussian distribution centered at 11 with a standard deviation of 1.
